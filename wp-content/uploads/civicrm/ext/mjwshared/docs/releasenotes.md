## Information

Releases use the following numbering system:
**{major}.{minor}.{incremental}**

* major: Major refactoring or rewrite - make sure you read and test very carefully!
* minor: Breaking change in some circumstances, or a new feature. Read carefully and make sure you understand the impact of the change.
* incremental: A "safe" change / improvement. Should *always* be safe to upgrade.

* **[BC]**: Items marked with [BC] indicate a breaking change that will require updates to your code if you are using that code in your extension.

## Release 1.2.14 (2023-08-14)

* [!41](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/merge_requests/41) The extension fails to install or upgrade if the option value for cg extends already present in the database (fix compatibility with extensions that use custom fields on financial transactions).

## Release 1.2.13 (2023-06-26)

* smartyv2-1.0.1 does not work on 5.59 because of https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/commit/7168793c03ef57c06bbfe45f5ff873ebb3657806
so we set minimum version to 5.58 which triggers civix to ship as an extension mixin.

## Release 1.2.12 (2023-06-25)

* Add Payment_details custom field group and allow custom fields to be saved via API3 `Mjwpayment.create`.
* Pass through custom params in `updateContributionCompleted()`.

* Use getter for `_paymentProcessor`.

## Release 1.2.11 (2023-01-30)

* Remove our version of CRM_Core_Payment::getAmount() as it was merged into core in 5.37.
* Fix undefined variable basePage on frontend formbuilder pages.

## Release 1.2.10 (2022-11-22)

* Make sure calculateTaxAmount always returns a valid float.

## Release 1.2.9 (2022-10-14)

* Add psr0 classloader to info.xml.
* Don't update (set update to never) Paymentprocessorwebhooks managed job (stops it re-enabling automatically).
* Upgrade civix.
* Fix [#18](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/issues/18) Don't add refund link if no payment processor.

## Release 1.2.8 (2022-08-19)

* Multiple participants: Handle 100% discount. Fix [Stripe#372](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/stripe/-/issues/372) etc. when additional participant amount is more than first participant.
* Convert getTokenParameter() to use propertyBag.
* Fix [!35](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/merge_requests/35) style issues with Greenwich; also nicer formatting of raw data.

## Release 1.2.5 (2022-05-19)

* Refunds: Add a lock around recording refund payment in `MJWIPNTrait::updateContributionRefund()`. This means we should not record a duplicate refund if both UI and IPN are processed at the same time.
* Update return params from `doRefund()`.
* [!33](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/merge_requests/33) Add processor filter to webhooks list page.

* Only delete old webhook entries for our domain (when multiple domains configured).
* Add system check to make sure that scheduled jobs are setup on all domains.

## Release 1.2

**Thanks to [ArtfulRobot](https://artfulrobot.uk) this release improves the webhook queueing system
and adds a user interface to view/manage webhooks.**

* Fix [#6](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/issues/6) Install error on 0.9.7.
    - This was because the new settings file referenced a class from the Stripe extension.

* Fix Failed->Completed for `updateContributionCompleted()` (you now need to pass in `contribution_status_id` as a parameter).
* Fix issues with params for Contribution.repeattransaction and IPNs (wrong params were being passed causing issues with completing contributions and duplicate payments).
* Check if we've already loaded CRM.payment library and don't reload if we have.

## Release 0.9

**We are renaming this library to "Payment Shared". In some places you will see "Mjwshared" and in others "Payment Shared". They are the same thing!**

* Allow completing a contribution that has Failed status via `updateContributionCompleted()`.
* Add basic function for updating a contribution (eg. the `trxn_id`) without touching other things.

* Add `Mjwpayment.notificationretry` that allows retrying IPN notifications stored in the `civicrm_system_log` table.

#### CRM.payment library

* Load crm.payment.js before any payment processor scripts. Loaded in `page-header` unless client is webform-civicrm when we load in `billing-block`.
* Add getIsRecur() function.
* Allow the client to override/define their own CRM.payment.getTotalAmount() function (currently used by webform_civicrm - see https://github.com/colemanw/webform_civicrm/pull/331).

#### Shared PHP libraries (MjwTrait and MjwIPNTrait)

* **[BC]** Convert beginDoPayment and getRecurringContributionId now require a `\Civi\Payment\PropertyBag` object instead of an array as parameter.


## Release 0.8.1

* Fixes and improvements to system checks.
* Enhance getErrorUrl function and fixes for CiviCRM 5.27+

## Release 0.8
**This release contains breaking changes**

* Switch to contribution.repeattransaction and payment.create API functions.
* Initial support for \Civi\Payment\PropertyBag. Add new CRM.payment library. Add WebhookTrait

## Release 0.7

* Implement buildAsset hook so that assets can be loaded via AssetBuilder without the [minifier](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/minifier) extension being available.
* Recommend minifier extension (and implement a dummy buildAsset hook so extensions using buildAsset for the minifier will still work without it).
* Recommend contributiontransactlegacy extension if drupal webform_civicrm is enabled.
* Implements setExceptionMode to allow skipping the exit on exception policy [!5](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/merge_requests/5).
* Add compat functions to work around issues with `\Civi::resources()->addVars()` - This improves compatibility for forms with multiple payment processors.

## Release 0.4

* Fix issue with non-default currency on form when you can choose from more than one payment processor on the form.
* Add `getTokenParameter()`/`setTokenParameter()` functions to MJWTrait which should be used when setting parameters
via javascript (eg. Stripe `paymentIntentID`) which are required when the payment is actually processed (via `doPayment()`).

## Release 0.3

* Major refactor of MJWIPNTrait.
* Add function to update the transaction ID for a payment related to a contribution.
