# Payment Shared library

This library is used by all payment processors by MJW Consulting and other extensions.

It provides multiple functions such as APIs, refund UI, shared code and a compatibility layer to support multiple versions of CiviCRM without requiring explicit support in the payment processor.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

**Always read the [Release Notes](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/blob/master/docs/releasenotes.md) carefully before upgrading!**
